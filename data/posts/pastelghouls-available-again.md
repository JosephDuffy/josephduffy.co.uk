pastelghouls is once again [available for download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1165855586?pt=96178896&ct=pastelghouls-available-again-blog-post&mt=8 "pastelghouls on the App Store"). It's a free sticker pack containing 6 ghoulish sticker. Originally released 19th October 2016, just in time for halloween, it was removed from the App Store December 7th 2019 due to not having an update for a substantial period of time.

As part of my [year of small](/posts/year-of-small) I wanted to make this available again, and at the same time setup fastlane to automate the screenshots and store the app metadata to make future updates easier.

pastelghouls was created by my friend Joshua Robins and published by my company Yetii Ltd.
