Today I have released the 1.0.0 version of a Swift package that aids with adding `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance by using `KeyPath`s.

The package is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/JosephDuffy/HashableByKeyPath/).

I created the [Swift Playground that sparked this concept in December 2018](/images/HashableByKeyPath/playground-metadata.png), so this concept has been rattling around in my brain for a couple of years. The API has changed a _lot_ since the original concept, but the core has stayed the same: a protocol that requires a single function to be implemented that uses `KeyPath`s to synthesise `Equatable` and/or `Hashable` conformance.

One of the mistakes I've made more times than I care to admit is comparing the wrong properties or objects when adding `Equatable` conformance, e.g.:

```swift
struct Foo: Equatable {
    static func == (lhs: Foo, rhs: Foo) -> Bool {
        return lhs.bar1 == rhs.bar1 && lhs.bar2 == rhs.bar1 && rhs.bar3 == rhs.bar3
    }

    var bar1: String
    var bar2: String
    var bar3: Int
}
```

These can be easy to type and hard to spot (even with better layout). The `EquatableByKeyPath` protocol fixes this issue:

```swift
struct Foo: EquatableByKeyPath {
    static func addEquatableKeyPaths<Consumer: EquatableKeyPathConsumer>(to consumer: inout Consumer) where Consumer.Root == Self {
        consumer.addEquatableKeyPath(\.bar1)
        consumer.addEquatableKeyPath(\.bar2)
        consumer.addEquatableKeyPath(\.bar3)
    }

    var bar1: String
    var bar2: String
    var bar3: Int
}
```

Adding the `addEquatableKeyPaths(to:)` function will synthesise `Equatable` conformance. Since you provide every `KeyPath` once it's not possible to compare the wrong properties or objects.

Another mistake I've made a lot is not keeping my `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance in sync. e.g. I add a new property but only add it to `==` and not `hash(into:)`. According to `Hashable`, this is bad:

> Hashing a value means feeding its essential components into a hash function, represented by the Hasher type. Essential components are those that contribute to the typeâ€™s implementation of Equatable. Two instances that are equal must feed the same values to Hasher in hash(into:), in the same order.

The `HashableByKeyPath` protocol fixes this issue:

```swift
struct Foo: HashableByKeyPath {
    static func addHashableKeyPaths<Consumer: HashableKeyPathConsumer>(to consumer: inout Consumer) where Consumer.Root == Self {
        consumer.addHashableKeyPath(\.bar1)
        consumer.addHashableKeyPath(\.bar2)
        consumer.addHashableKeyPath(\.bar3)
    }

    var bar1: String
    var bar2: String
    var bar3: Int
}
```

Adding the `addHashableKeyPaths(to:)` function will synthesise `Hashable`, `EquatableByKeyPath`, and `Equatable` conformance. Since you provide every `KeyPath` once and only have 1 functions it's not possible to compare the wrong properties or objects or have your `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformances out of sync.

I will admit that this can't replace _every_ `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance out there, but I've not had a scenario yet I had to manually implement `==` or `hash(into:)`.
