I've become accustomed to using yearly themes – rather than New Years resolution – thanks to CGP Grey, who has a [very good summary of yearly themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE).

It took me a while to home in on it but this year the title of my theme will be "Year of Small."

I'll be focusing on all things small:

- Small people: spending time with and giving the best life to my now 9-month-old son.
- Small home improvements: finally doing those small tasks and improvements, such as buying a bedside table and getting rid of things I no longer use.
- Small work: I want to focus on releasing smaller updates for existing project, alongside a higher quantity of smaller projects that serve as proof of concepts and methods of learning new technology.
- Small activities: small hobbies I can with my wife, such as new board games and outside activities.

At the end of the year I'll post a "year in review," although I hope to revisit this every 3 months to make sure I'm still focusing on the right things.

Anything related to this theme will be posted under the [year-of-small tag](/tags/year-of-small).
