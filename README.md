# Joseph Duffy's Blog

This repository contains the code to power [josephduffy.co.uk](https://josephduffy.co.uk), Joseph Duffy's personal website and blog.

Some aspects of the project are over-optimised for the sake of learning and trying out new technologies. Some aspects need some work. Pull requests are welcome.

## Technologies

The project was created to give me a way of learning and trying out a few new technologies. The project uses:

 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (4.2)
 - [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
 - [Express](https://github.com/strongloop/express)
 - [Poet](https://github.com/jsantell/poet)
 - [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
 - HTML5 (including microdata)
 - A custom icon font (using [Fontello](http://fontello.com/))
