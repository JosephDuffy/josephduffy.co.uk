      <h2>Magic Go To</h2>
      <p>
        After being frustrated with not being able to link to non-http websites
        I created Magic Go To. The feature set was minimal and simple: link to
        https://magicgo.to/https://example.com and it will redirect to
        https://example.com. Personally I use this for xcode: links.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        This used to be hosted at magicgo.to, but the cost of a .to domain was
        too high for the utility I gained from it. Maybe I should host it at
        magicgo.josephduffy.co.uk?

      <h2>Baking Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Baking Feedback was a project I ran while working at my first job after
        university. It enabled my colleagues to provide feedback on food I had
        baked and brought in the office. It used an emoji scoring system with a
        range of 🤢 🙁 😕 😋 🤤. It now redirects to{" "}

      <h2>Timetable Parser</h2>
      <p>
        Timetable Parser was a project I ran when I was a student at the
        University of Huddersfield. It enabled students to input their student
        number and provided methods to have their classes timetable available in
        calendar apps by providing an iCal feed. It now redirects to{" "}
        <Link href="/projects/timetable-parser">
          a small page dedicated to the project
        </Link>
        . It was also the subject of the{" "}
